# Both feeding stages of global, crop pollinating Diptera require diverse diet and habitat needs


For the complete list of pollinating fly species, their diet and habitat needs, and the biogeographical regions they currently occupy, please see "Fly diet and habitat needs.pdf" file


For the additional 12 species of pollinating flies where we were able to record habitat needs but not diet needs, please see "Habitat only database.pdf" file


To test the statistics completed in R, please download the 'rawhabitatdata1.csv' and 'fhabitat.csv' files as well as the 'R code.R' file that will open up into your R browser automatically (****I used RStudio as I have a Mac)
